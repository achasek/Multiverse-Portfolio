# Personal Instance of Spotify's Backstage

[**Deployment Module**](https://github.com/achasek/personal-backstage)

## Overview

I developed a personalized instance of Spotify's Backstage, the leading open-source developer portal, as part of a project aimed at mastering advanced enterprise-level concepts and streamlining repository management. This initiative involved extensive research into Backstage's architecture, configuration, and best practices, followed by practical implementation to tailor it to my unique requirements.

## Technologies

- **Custom Backstage Instance**: Configured Backstage to manage and monitor my personal repositories effectively, adapting its powerful catalog and plugin system to suit my needs.
- **CI/CD Practice**: Gained hands-on experience with modern DevOps practices, including continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows.
- **GitHub Actions**: Designed and implemented custom workflows for automating testing, building, and deploying updates.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and portability.
- **Enterprise-Level Concepts**: Explored and implemented foundational enterprise-grade principles such as service cataloging, tech documentation, and developer workflow optimization.
- **TypeScript and Node**: This application leverages a usage of TypeScript that requires a deep understanding of types.

## Competencies

- **Research & Implementation**: Conducted deep dives into Backstage's documentation and community resources to understand its extensible architecture and features.
- **DevOps Integration**: Applied Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration and created efficient CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment processes.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackled challenges in configuring Backstage for a standalone instance, debugging issues, and ensuring smooth operation within my environment.
