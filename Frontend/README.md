# Unified Frontend for Dual-Backend Integration

[**Frontend Module**](https://github.com/achasek/frontend-project-multiverse)

## Overview

In collaboration with a team, I developed a React-based frontend application designed to unify two distinct backend systems under a single, cohesive interface. This frontend acted as the central hub, seamlessly interacting with APIs from both backends to provide users with a consistent and dynamic experience.

## Technologies

- **React & Redux**: Leveraged React for building an intuitive, component-based user interface and Redux for efficient state management across the application.
- **TypeScript**: Used TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance maintainability, reducing potential bugs during development.
- **API Integration**: Designed and implemented mechanisms to retrieve and display data from multiple APIs, ensuring seamless communication with both backends.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Ensured the frontend was adaptable to interact with either backend system without modification, aligning with the projectâ€™s goal of backend flexibility.

## Competencies

- **Frontend Development**: Built reusable components and implemented responsive designs, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **State Management**: Structured Redux stores and actions for clear and efficient handling of asynchronous data retrieved from the APIs.
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked closely with backend developers and teammates, aligning on API structures, testing, and iterative improvements to the application.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed challenges in API compatibility and asynchronous data handling, ensuring the application performed reliably across both backends.
