# Dual-Backend Integration with a Unified Frontend

[**Backend Module Part 1**](https://github.com/Erob711/inventory-app-v2.git)
[**Backend Module Part 2**](https://github.com/achasek/Django-Inventory-Backend)

## Overview

Both as part of a collaborative team project as well as some solo development, I developed a robust application designed to demonstrate the seamless integration of two distinct backend systems with a single React-based frontend. This project aimed to explore the versatility of different backend technologies while ensuring a consistent configuration and user experience.

For the backend systems, I implemented two separate architectures:
- **Node.js, Express, and TypeScript**: Leveraging the power of JavaScript's ecosystem for a lightweight and scalable backend.
- **Python and Django**: Utilizing Django's robust framework for rapid development and built-in administrative tools.

Each backend was engineered to expose a uniform API, ensuring that the shared React frontend could seamlessly interact with either system without modification. The frontend, built with React, served as a dynamic interface to consume the data and services provided by both backends.

## Competencies

This project showcased my ability to adapt to diverse technologies, maintain consistency across systems, and collaborate effectively within a team to deliver a functional, user-friendly application.

- **Comprehensive Backend Development**: Designed and implemented both backend systems, ensuring they adhered to consistent API specifications despite differences in technology stacks.
- **Seamless Frontend Integration**: Developed a modular and flexible React frontend capable of interfacing with both backends seamlessly.
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked closely with teammates to plan, test, and refine the project, fostering a collaborative environment that emphasized communication and shared problem-solving.
- **Technical Innovation**: Explored cross-technology compatibility, enhancing my expertise in backend and frontend integrations.
